### A Framework for developing Business Functions that call Business Services (BSSV) in JD Edwards
---
This is the start of an application to aid in the development of JD Edwards Business Services. This will only work on a UNIX based system (developed here on Linux), and will need to be modified for the appropriate IP address, socket, and SOAP envelope.

When building on windows, watch the LF characters.  You might need to recreate the build file (dos2unix), or else just issue the command directly.  This has been done successfully using cygwin and gcc.
